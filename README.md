# Roughtime

This repository contains an implementation of the Roughtime protocol described in the [IETF Roughtime draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-ntp-roughtime).

Roughtime is a protocol that aims to achieve rough time synchronization while detecting servers that provide inaccurate time with cryptographic proof of their malfeasance. It may also be used as a single-server protocol to retrieve a verifiable timestamp.
